        </h2>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          The Decameron&apos;s world builds itself in every story, between every
          storytellers, and through the author. The deeply nested series of
          fictional storytellers each with their own motives, relationships, and
          personalities, give each word a myriad of implications in a deeply
          entangled web of connected worlds.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          The bidirectional communication between layers of worlds was the most
          impactful insight that Dr. Shemek&apos;s lectures had on me. It&apos;s
          not that a story informs us about the characters and what the
          characters represent, or that the character&apos;s personalities can
          give us insight to the story. Instead, Boccaccio uses the stories, the
          character he decides should tell each story, the author, the
          author&apos;s comments, and every other word in the book to his
          arguments and justify his claims.

        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          This sounds surprisingly mundane when typed out, but I promise that,
          in my head, the number of connections I am making and relationships I
          am considering is far to overwhelming and profound to transcribe in a
          five minute read.

          Just in one example, consider the very first story told on Day One

          UCI&apos;s Worldbuilding

          UCI is a world so massive that one can simply not hope to fully
          explore it. There are countless subgroups, cultures, social events,
          and academic opportunities, that one&apos;s experience is shaped by
          their decisions. In fact, every person is building their own world
          just by attending UCI.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          Being at UCI feels like being a member of the{" "}
          <span className="italic inline">brigata</span>, in the best way
          possible! UCI is a shared experience for every student, just as the
          black death was a shared trauma for the world. At UCI, students can
          choose their own path. There are those who revel in social networking
          aspect, those who love the Greek life, the engineers who just make
          junk, and everything between. This akin to the countless reactions
          that people had to the bubonic plague in The Decameron, including
          indulgence, religious devotion, and escapism.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          Just as the <span className="italic inline">brigata</span> constructed
          their world off of their stories, us anteaters construct it off of our
          actions. The connections that we make, the conflicts that we have, and
          the works that we create are a reflection of our character. Each of
          our characters and worlds combine into the larger UCI world, which is
          something so massive and nuanced that no one student, professor, or
          administrator can experience it all. Instead, the best we can do is
          continue building our own world, exploring our character, and learning
          from the worlds of others through conversation.

        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          The choices that students make (and also those that are made for them
          ðŸ’€) also define the UCI they experience, which is the world that their
          character lives in. In the most simple example, I was fortunate enough
          to get to dorm in Middle Earth Towers!! Many of my friends are from
          the slums (middle earth classics), and even within classics friends
          there are a massive range of experiences. In my world, my character
          presented forethought in finding 3 roommates to request to room in
          towers, the UCI that I live in has fenominal housing and living
          conditions (thus far).

          slightly warm and fuzzy stuffy feeling (which is a relieving break

          just forces one of us to get up, helps us keep track of time, and is

          Calmindon's study room my study spot and Isengaurd's study room my
          social hall? Because groups of friends have gotten together and
          sectioned off their responsibilities, into different physical spaces,
          therefore forming those physical spaces to have metaphysical
          implications.

          In our case, my Calmindon friends and I have decided to designate

          of this agreement, we make Calmindon a study space for the full world
          of UCI this year; a space where anyone can come and be surrounded
          people that support their, answer their questions, and study with
          them.
