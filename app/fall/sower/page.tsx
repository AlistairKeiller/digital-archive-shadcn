          who is crippled by hyperempathy, a result of the prolific drug use of
          her mother during pregnancy. Lauren is a visionary who creates a new
          religion called Earthseed, which is based on the idea that &quot;God

          &quot;God is Change&quot; is the beating heart of the novel. It

          did not care enough about the impact on their world, leaving global
          warming &apos;for later,&apos; and this generation with debilitating
          generational debt. This can result from the non-consequentialist
          attitude of a Baptist minister, who believes that God starts,
          overlooks, and maintains a balance, and all one needs to do is act
          morally and in His world.

          This removes much of the responsibility from individuals, as it&apos;s
          not up to them to ensure that things like global warming and drug use
          stay under control. The concept of &quot;God is Change&quot; is a
          stark contrast to the non-consequentialist view of God, as it places
          the responsibility of change on the individual. &quot;God is
          Change&quot; is bidirectional in the sense it is equivalent to
          &quot;Change is God.&quot; This means that we, mere humans, have the

          Survival is not about surviving since death is temporary and
          inconsequential. Instead, it adds another aspect of resource
          management and restriction that adds depth to the world. In creative,
          you could have houses made of diamond blocks that are more ubiquitous
          than wood and not a single mine to source those diamonds. In creative,
          the functionality of farms is moot, so they are uncommon at best.
          Survival adds realism (even in a world as absurd, blocky, and
          unrealistic as Minecraft). In survival, people optimize resource
          production with automatic farms, build massive redstone contraptions,
          and excavate/terraform entire biomes for resources and beautification.
          It feels like a reflection of modern first-world capitalist society,
          as the player selfishly shapes the world around him to his own needs
          when those needs are just self-imposed, completely unrelated to an
          objective measure of success (since &quot;beating&quot; the game, by
          beating the ender dragon, is trivial, and is almost never a survival
          player&apos;s final objective).

          Reading <span className="italic">Parable of the Sower</span> caught my
          attention because of the striking similarity (and also some stark
          differences). While Lauren struggles to defend herself due to her
          hyperempathy, Aang struggles to defend himself due to his pacifism,
          based both on his religious ideals and his feeling of overwhelming
          responsibility and guilt. In short, the fire nation desires world
          domination, while The Avatar (Aang) represents the natural state and
          balance in the world. The Fire Nation, blinded by their technological
          advancements and greed, started a war for world domination and wiped
          out the entire air nation to prevent The Avatar from being born, and
          balance was maintained. Aang was trapped in ice for the entire
          duration of the war (because he was overwhelmed with his
          responsibilities), and we wake up to a world where his people are
          extinct and could not be less balanced.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          As a Buddhist and a pacifist, Aang can&apos;t even bring himself to
          kill in self-defense or to destabilize The Fire Nation, even though
          other avatars and Buddhists believe and are adamant that it is the
          only way to restore balance. Aang eventually solves it by unlocking a
          new form of bending (no more spoilers!).
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          Aang&apos;s predicament is similar to Lauren&apos;s in that they are
          both aversed to killing and inflicting pain in a world where it seems
          like the only way. From their perspective, they view themselves as
          weak, crippled, and inadequate for their abnormality. But their
          difference allows them to present a unique worldview and solve
          problems in new ways, oftentimes that the world needs. I have not read
          the outcome of Earthseed through{" "}
          <span className="italic">Parable of the Talents</span>, but it&apos;s
          clearly a movement that philosophically aligns with the buildings,
          care, and responsibility that Lauren&apos;s world so desperately
          needs.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          One stark difference is the threats that they propose humanity has to
          itself. In ATLA, the Fire Nation&apos;s rise to power represents
          social injustices and economic inequality created by rapid
          technological progress. It is saying that, in the wrong hands, it
          could create an all-powerful dictatorship (a reflection of a scenario
          where the Soviet Union wins the war and becomes the most
          technologically advanced nation).{" "}
          <span className="italic">Parable of the Sower</span> presents a much
          more nuanced concern about the future. The destruction Lauren sees
          (both her hyperempathy and what she loses) is a result of drug misuse
          and overdoes (with Pyro and Paracetco). In this comparison, it&apos;s
          almost comical how non-influential drugs are in ATLA; its main
          explicit drug use is purely a comedic relief to their desert journey.

          Some Virtual Introspection (Conclusion)

          The concept of &quot;God is Change&quot; in a dystopian is the theme
          of this website. To get here, you had to burn down an entire blank
          page, with no way to get it back (or at least not with a simple
          refresh)! I built this as the best reflection I could of both
          hyperempathy and Earthseed, which is basically Lauren&apos;s life.
          Imagine I put a Dog on the first page! I am not evil enough to build
          such a depiction, and I hope you wouldn&apos;t press that button
          either! Was viewing this website worth burning the page? Would it be
          worth burning a virtual dog?

          Everyone has to be the change they want to see (however cliche that
          sounds), even if it&apos;s hard or near impossible to carry out (like
          Lauren killing for what&apos;s right and her own survival and
          effectively feeling death in the process). You participated in the
          study of destroying one thing to see another, and we all do it all the
          time, every day, even if we don&apos;t see it. I think Earthseed, this
          website, <span className={`${Monocraft.className}`}>Minecraft</span>,
          and{" "}
          <span className={`${atla.className}`}>

          , and <span className="italic">Parable of the Sower</span> are all
          exploring this same concept in a more explicit sense.
