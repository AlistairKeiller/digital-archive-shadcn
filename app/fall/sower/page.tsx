          <span className="italic">Parable of the Sower</span> reflects a
          destyopian future where the world is ravaged by climate change,
          corporate greed, and economic inequality. We follow Lauren Olamina,
          who is crippled by hyperempathy, a result of the prolific drug use of
          her mother during pregnancy. Lauren is a visionary who creates a new
          religion called Earthseed, which is based on the idea that &quot;God
          is Change.&quot;

        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          &quot;God is change&quot; is the beating heart of the novel. It
          reflects the state of the destyopian society; the generations before
          did not have enough care for the impact in their world, leaving global
          warming &apos;for later,&apos; and this generation with dehibilitating
          generational debt. This can result from the nonconsequentialist
          additute of a Baptist minister, which belives that God starts,
          overlooks, and maintains a balance, and all one needs to do is act
          morally and in his world.

        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          This removes much of the responsilibty from individals, as it&apos;s
          not up to them to ensure that things like global warming and drug use
          stay under control. The concept of &quot;God is Change&quot; is a
          stark contrast to the nonconsequentialist view of God, as it places
          the responsibility of change on the individual. &quot;God is
          Change&quot; is bidirectional, in the sense it is equivlent tp
          &quot;Change is God.&quot; So any change is a reflection of God, is
          not somehow infiorir to holu change. That means that us, mere humans,
          have the power, and therefore responabiity, to &quot;Shape God.&quot;
