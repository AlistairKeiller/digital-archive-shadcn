          <span className="italic">Parable of the Sower</span> reflects a
          dystopian future where the world is ravaged by climate change,
          corporate greed, and economic inequality. We follow Lauren Olamina,
          who is crippled by hyperempathy, a result of the prolific drug use of
          her mother during pregnancy. Lauren is a visionary who creates a new
          religion called Earthseed, which is based on the idea that &quot;God
          is Change.&quot;
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          &quot;God is change&quot; is the beating heart of the novel. It
          reflects the state of the dystopian society; the generations before
          did not have enough care for the impact in their world, leaving global
          warming &apos;for later,&apos; and this generation with debilitating
          generational debt. This can result from the non-consequentialist
          attitude of a Baptist minister, who believes that God starts,
          overlooks, and maintains a balance, and all one needs to do is act
          morally and in his world.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          This removes much of the responsibility from individuals, as it&apos;s
          not up to them to ensure that things like global warming and drug use
          stay under control. The concept of &quot;God is Change&quot; is a
          stark contrast to the non-consequentialist view of God, as it places
          the responsibility of change on the individual. &quot;God is
          Change&quot; is bidirectional in the sense it is equivalent to
          &quot;Change is God.&quot; So, any change is a reflection of God, and
          it is not somehow inferior to holy change. That means that we, mere
          humans, have the power, and therefore responsibility, to &quot;Shape
          God.&quot;

          The concept of &quot;God is Change&quot; in a dystopian is the theme
          of this website. To get here, you had to burn down an entire blank
          page, with no way to get it back (or at least not with a simple
          refresh)! I built this as the best reflection I could of both
          hyperempathy and Earthseed, which is basically Lauren&apos;s life.
          Imagine I put a Dog on the first page! I am not evil enough to build
          such a depiction, and I hope you wouldn&apos;t press that button
          either! Was viewing this website worth burning the page? Would it be

          Everyone has to be the change they want to see (however cliche that
          sounds), even if it&apos;s hard or near impossible to carry out (like
          Lauren killing for what&apos;s right and her own survival and
          effectively feeling death in the process). You participated in the
          study of destroying one thing to see another, and we all do it all the
          time, every day, even if we don&apos;t see it. I think both Earthseed,
          this website, and <span className="italic">Parable of the Sower</span>{" "}

          , Minecraft has been about creating a world. Just look at the order of
          development! Building, exploration, and game mechanics always preceded
          health, hunger, and survival. Minecraft is unique and timeless to me
          because it is not about winning, surviving, or competing; just about
          playing, whatever that means to the player.

          Creative has all the of the core gameplay: players can make whatever
          they want, with no concern about gathering materials. People spend
          years building worlds that are a reflection of their own, and it can
          even be used as a critical source of information, namely{" "}

          Survival is not about surviving since death is temporary and
          inconsequential. Instead, it adds another aspect of resource
          management and restriction that adds depth to the world. In creative,
          you could have houses made of diamond blocks that are more ubiquitous
          than wood and not a single mine to source those diamonds. In creative,
          the functionality of farms is moot, so they are uncommon at best.
          Survival adds realism (even in a world as absurd, blocky, and
          unrealistic as Minecraft). In survival, people optimize resource
          production with automatic farms, build massive redstone contraptions,
          and excavate/terraform entire biomes for resources and beautification.
          It feels like a reflection of modern first-world capitalist society,
          as the player selfishly shapes the world around him to his own needs
          when those needs are just self-imposed, completely unrelated to an
          objective measure of success (since &quot;beating&quot; the game, by
          beating the ender dragon, is trivial, and is almost never a survival
          player&apos;s final objective).

          Finally, Hardcore is a reflection of us, living life itself. It is
